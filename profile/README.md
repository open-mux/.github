Open MUX is a (Work in Progress) open framework for creating Multi-User XR applications.

It consists of:
- A Server which functions as the main connection hub and source of truth.
- A Unity Package which can be installed into your own project to add multi-user functionality to it.
- A Management GUI which visually displays the currently connected clients.
